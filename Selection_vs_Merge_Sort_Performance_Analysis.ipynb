        "The merge sort algorithm was more time- and resource-efficient than the selection sort algorithm in all cases. This was illustrated using various datasets which tested the algorithms' adaptability from their default behavior. In every practical case, it was better to use the merge sort algorithm to sort the list. The only case where the selection sort algorithm would be preferable is with a list that had very few elements because the merge sort algorithm would have to divide the list before making logical comparisons. Another disadvantage with selection sort is its tendency to make the same number of comparisons regardless of the order. By contrast, the merge sort algorithm only makes a high number of comparisons with a randomly-ordered dataset."
